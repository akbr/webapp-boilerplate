A simple, react-ready boilerplate project.
Includes auto-rebuilding browserify and livereload.
Browserify caches all dependencies for faster reloading.

* `npm install`
* Add dependencies in package.json (as desired)
* Tweak livereload host in package.json (as desired)
* `gulp build`
* `gulp`
* Connect to build/index.html

Edit away!

Note: If add add dependencies to package.json, you must re-run `gulp build`.S
